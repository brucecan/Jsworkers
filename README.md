# jsworkers
Javascript parallel-computing library for both node.js and browser environment, no dependencies. It's created by modifying the source code of parallel.js (https://github.com/parallel-js/parallel.js), which is a well designed tiny library for multi-core processing in Javascript environment. jsworkers provides some handy additions like worker thread support (for node.js), unlimited function chaining, built-in promise support ...... to make javascript parallel programming even more interesting. 

## Installation
### For node.js app:
```
$ npm install jsworkers
```
### For web app:
```
<script src='./jsworkers/lib/index.js'></script>
```
## Usage
### Cover all the features provided by [parallel.js](https://github.com/parallel-js/parallel.js)<br/>
Additionally, jsworkers supports:
### Three types of parallel execution
jsworkers supports process (node.js), worker thread (node.js) and web worker (browser). For node.js app, worker thread is preferable considering forking processes is expensive in terms of resources. When running on a node.js instance without worker-thread feature enabled (v10.x.x or before)ï¼Œprocess will be selected as an alternative. In browser, web worker is the only choice for jsworkers.

For the node.js environment that supports both (process & worker thread), you have the discretion to choose any of them by specifing the "options" parameter either for the Jsworkers constructor or for the steOptions method:

Constructor way:
```
// use process instead of worker thread
let Jsworkers = new Jsworkers(data, {processPreferred: true}); 
```
setOptions way:
```
// use worker thead instead of process
// the second parameter of setOptions() method is related with function chaining and will be explained later.
Jsworkers.setOptions({processPreferred: false}, true); 
```
Without the options, worker thead will be selected as default.

### Promise and unlimited chaining
......

Require the jsworkers module and create a `Jsworkers` instance:
```js
var Jsworkers = require("./jsworkers");
var data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
            11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,
	    21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,
	    31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,
	    41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,
	    51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,
	    61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,
	    71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,
	    81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,
	    91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100];
var jsworkers = new Jsworkers(data);

function log(result) {
  console.log(result);
  return result;
}

function square(n) {
  return n * n;
}

function add(d) {
  return d[0] + d[1];
}

jsworkers.map(square).then(log).reduce(add).then(log);
```
Output
```
